# Glass OS  

## Backstory  

The idea of creating my own operating system came up a long time ago, but at first I didn’t have enough knowledge. I initially built a prototype in **Roblox** to test the basic concept. Later, I started developing an OS for the **OpenComputers** mod.  

At first, I planned to make a simple OS, but over time I wanted something more advanced and similar to **Windows 2000** – with a graphical interface, windows, and various GUI elements.

## Status  

⚠️ **Glass OS does not work yet!**  
The project is in an early stage of development. The files exist, but the system still requires improvements to be fully functional.
